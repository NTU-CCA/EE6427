# EE6427 - Video Signal Processing, Fall 2018

### Learning Objective:

The objective of this course is to provide students with knowledge in image and video signal processing. This course focuses on advanced topics in image and video processing, especially on the image filter, image and video compression, and some international standards for image and video processing. All of these topics are important to the understanding of image and video technologies and applications.

### Content:

Image and Video Basics. Image and Video Transform Coding. Filtering and Error Resilience for Image and Video. Image and Video Coding Principles and Standards. Recent and Emerging Topics in Image and Video Processing.

### Learning Outcome:

Through this course, students are expected to gain in-depth knowledge of image and video compression, and some international standards for image and video processing. Besides, it is hoped that through learning the theories, it may help students to develop some state-of-the-art image and video processing applications. This course will also arouse students’ interest in the course and further motivate them towards developing their career in the area of multimedia processing.
